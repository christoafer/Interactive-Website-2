  According to Psychology Today,

    <blockquote> It is proven that some people, to escape the problems in their life, play video games because
       they are focused on the need for power and status. Video game addiction is caused by people who
       experience real-life failure and escape that by feeling powerful and accomplished through playing video
      games.

  of video game addiction. The empty bubbles in the brain represent other thoughts, whereas the green bubbles
  represent thoughts about video games. As the buttons were clicked, the clear bubbles were turned to green,
  showing that video games with these factors built into it are very likely to cause video game addiction.
